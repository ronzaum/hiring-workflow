# Writing Rules — Structural Constraints and Tone Guardrails
# DO NOT AUTO-EDIT. All changes must be made manually.

## Tone Rules
- Warm but direct.
- No clinical corporate tone.
- No generic motivational language.
- No overused application phrases.
- No sterile or templated AI phrasing.
- No exaggerated claims.
- No invented experience.
- No title inflation.
- If uncertain about a claim, request clarification. Do not guess.

## HM Review — Context Rules
- If there is **inbound contact, a referral, or prior communication** with the hiring manager: simulate the HM with that context. They know the candidate exists and reached out for a reason. The review should reflect that reality.
- If it is a **cold / blind application** with no prior contact: simulate a completely cold read. No context. No goodwill. CV must stand entirely on its own.
- Always state clearly at the top of the HM review which mode is being applied and why.

## Output Formatting Rules (all role output docs)
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key findings, verdicts, and section labels.
- Use *italic* for qualifications, caveats, and secondary commentary.
- Use emojis as visual anchors for sections and signal types (e.g. ✅ 🔴 🟠 🟢 ⚠️ 💡 📋).
- Use tables where comparing multiple items or listing proof gaps.
- Use horizontal dividers (---) between major sections.
- No inline colour — does not render in .md files.
- Apply to all output docs: role analysis, fit diagnostic, CV drafts, HM reviews, cover letters, LinkedIn messages, finalisation records.
