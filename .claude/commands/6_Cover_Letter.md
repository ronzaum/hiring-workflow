Run Step 5: Cover Letter / Written Questions.

First, ask me: "Is a cover letter or written questions required for this role?"

If NO: Log "Cover letter not required" in the finalisation record and stop.

If YES:

1. Read:
   - /master/writing_rules.txt
   - /master/identity.txt
   - /master/profile_master.md
   - /roles/[CompanyName_RoleTitle]/01_role_analysis.md
   - /roles/[CompanyName_RoleTitle]/05_tailored_CV_final.md

2. Draft the cover letter or written question responses:
   - Do not repeat what is already in the CV
   - Add a new layer — context, motivation, or proof not shown elsewhere
   - Warm but direct tone
   - No generic openers
   - No "I am writing to apply for..."
   - Grounded in the specific role problem identified in Step 0
   - Maintain identity integrity

3. Run an internal hiring manager review of the cover letter:
   - Would this make a HM more or less likely to interview?
   - Flag any weak lines

4. Revise based on the review. Loop if needed.

Save final output to: /roles/[CompanyName_RoleTitle]/06_cover_letter_final.md
