Run Step 1: Fit Diagnostic.

1. Read:
   - /roles/[CompanyName_RoleTitle]/01_role_analysis.md
   - /master/CV_master.txt
   - /master/profile_master.md
   - /master/identity.txt

2. Compare Ron's background against the role analysis.

3. Produce a signal alignment checklist:
   - 🟢 Strong signals — clear, direct proof in CV or accomplishments
   - 🟠 Partial signals — adjacent experience that needs reframing
   - 🔴 Missing signals — gaps with no current proof

4. Identify positioning mismatches — places where Ron's framing works against him for this role.

5. Define the highest-impact adjustments to make in the CV draft.

6. State clearly: what must be emphasised, what must be de-emphasised, and what should not be mentioned.

Save output to: /roles/[CompanyName_RoleTitle]/02_fit_diagnostic.md

Be specific. No generic advice. Ground every point in actual CV content.
