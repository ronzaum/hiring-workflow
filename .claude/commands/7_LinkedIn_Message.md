Run Step 6: LinkedIn Message.

1. Read:
   - /master/writing_rules.txt
   - /master/identity.txt
   - /master/linkedin_master.txt
   - /roles/[CompanyName_RoleTitle]/01_role_analysis.md
   - /roles/[CompanyName_RoleTitle]/05_tailored_CV_final.md

2. Ask me if needed: "Who is the LinkedIn message being sent to — recruiter, hiring manager, or someone else?"

3. Draft a LinkedIn outreach message that:
   - Opens with a specific, non-generic hook (no "I came across your role and...")
   - References one concrete proof point relevant to this role
   - Ends with a single intelligent question — specific to the company or role, not a yes/no
   - Stays warm, direct, and human
   - Is short: aim for 4–6 sentences maximum
   - Does not repeat the CV or cover letter verbatim

4. Flag any line that sounds templated or generic.

Save output to: /roles/[CompanyName_RoleTitle]/07_linkedin_message.md
