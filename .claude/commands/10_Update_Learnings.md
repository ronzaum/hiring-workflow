Run Step 9: Update Learnings.

Your job is to synthesise intelligence from all completed applications and update the learnings document. This is not logging — it is pattern recognition across the full body of work.

1. Read the current learnings document:
   - /workflow/system/learnings.md

2. Read all system logs:
   - /workflow/system/application_tracker.md
   - /workflow/system/rejection_log.md
   - /workflow/system/master_change_log.md

3. Read every completed role folder in /workflow/roles/:
   - For each role, read:
     - 01_role_analysis.md (go/no-go, probability estimate)
     - 02_fit_diagnostic.md (signal gaps)
     - 04_HM_review.md (what the HM flagged)
     - 08_finalisation_record.md (final probability, outcome if known)
   - Skip roles that do not have a finalisation record — they are not complete.

4. Read:
   - /workflow/master/identity.txt
   - /workflow/master/writing_rules.txt

5. Synthesise across all completed applications. Look for:
   - What signals consistently land well across HM reviews
   - What signals consistently generate doubts or rejection risks
   - Which proof points are doing the most work
   - Which claims keep getting flagged as unsupported
   - Whether certain role types are converting better than others
   - Patterns in rejection (stage, reason, role type)
   - Tone or phrasing patterns that appear in strong vs weak drafts
   - Positioning gaps that keep appearing across roles (irreducible vs fixable)
   - Any open hypotheses worth testing in future applications

6. Before editing, show me a plain-language summary of:
   - How many applications were analysed
   - The top 3–5 patterns you found
   - What you intend to change or add in learnings.md
   Wait for my confirmation before writing.

7. After confirmation, update /workflow/system/learnings.md:
   - Edit sections in place — do not append raw notes
   - Update the interview rate table with current numbers
   - Update "Last Updated" and "Applications Analysed"
   - Append a row to the Change Log at the bottom
   - Write in clear, direct prose — no filler, no hedging
   - Every insight must be grounded in specific evidence from the role folders

Do not invent patterns. Only write what the data supports.
